# AI Home CoPilot — Ethics & Governance

This repository provides the **Core add-on** used by AI Home CoPilot.

## Non‑negotiables

> These are defaults, not dogma. If a maxim blocks a clearly better solution, we revisit it explicitly (issue + rationale + safeguards + doc update).

- Privacy-first, local-first by default.
- Governance-first: suggestions before actions, explicit confirmation, reversible changes.
- Explainability over optimization.
- Autonomy disabled by default.
