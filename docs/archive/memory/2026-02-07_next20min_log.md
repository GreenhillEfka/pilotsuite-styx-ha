# Worklog — 2026-02-07 — Next 20min autonomous dev

## Context
User asked to continue development autonomously for ~20 minutes, with a focus on the stable core plan, and to not forget a "Dev surface" for better insight.

## Completed
- MediaContext v0.1 validated by user (music active / tv active correct).
- Implemented HA-native Diagnostics endpoint (sanitized) for ai_home_copilot.
- Added Dev surface documentation:
  - docs/DEV_SURFACE.md
  - linked from docs/START_HERE.md
- Tagged + released integration v0.1.18.

## Notes
- Diagnostics intentionally redacts token.
- Diagnostics best-effort includes:
  - core status
  - last devlogs (via core API)
  - media_context snapshot

## Follow-ups / Questions for user
- Do they want to update to v0.1.18 now or batch updates later? (HACS updates require HA restart)
