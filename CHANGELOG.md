Implements PROJECT_PLAN N1 requirement to display evidence information in Repairs UI for better suggestion transparency.

#### Added
- **Evidence in Suggestion UI**: Candidate suggestions now display statistical confidence metrics
  - Support percentage: How often this pattern was observed
  - Confidence: Statistical confidence in the pattern recognition  
  - Lift: How much more likely this pattern is compared to random
  - Example: "CoPilot Vorschlag: A→B Pattern (Support: 85% | Konfidenz: 92% | Lift: 3.2)"

#### Enhanced

- Evidence formatting handles missing data gracefully (empty string when no evidence available)
- Maintains backward compatibility with candidates without evidence data

This enhancement addresses governance and transparency requirements by making the AI decision-making process more visible to users.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-02-10

### 🫀 N3 Forwarder Quality Enhancements

Enhanced N3 event forwarder with heartbeat monitoring and improved zone inference per Alpha Worker specification.

#### Added

  - Uses state value (e.g., "bedroom", "office") as zone when no static mapping exists
  - Handles common HA zone states like "home", "not_home" intelligently
  - Falls back to device/area-based static mapping

#### Technical
- Follows N3 specification for Core health monitoring
- Heartbeat envelope format: `{"v":1,"kind":"heartbeat","ts":"...","src":"ha","entity_count":142}`
- Enhanced statistics include heartbeat configuration

#### Technical Implementation
- Integrates with Core Add-on v0.4.9 dashboard APIs
- Uses existing `async_call_core_api` infrastructure for Core communication
- Formats technical data into user-friendly notification summaries
- Graceful error handling with informative error messages

#### Quality Assurance
- ✅ Full py_compile validation for button.py changes

- **Additional Entities**: Add custom entity IDs via comma-separated configuration field
- **Better Zone Mapping**: Media players automatically mapped to "media" zone for enhanced categorization
- **Privacy Controls**: Fine-grained control over which Home Assistant entities are shared with Core

#### Technical
- **Configurable Allowlist**: Three new config options for entity filtering control
- **Zone-aware Categorization**: Entities properly mapped to zones (Habitus, media, additional) for better context
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing behavior preserved with sensible defaults (Habitus zones + media players enabled)
- **Performance Optimized**: Only subscribe to state changes for explicitly allowed entities

#### Added
- `events_forwarder_include_habitus_zones` (default: true) - Include entities from Habitus zones
- `events_forwarder_include_media_players` (default: true) - Include configured music/TV media players  
- `events_forwarder_additional_entities` - CSV list of additional entity IDs to forward

This enhancement provides users with granular control over data privacy while maintaining the intelligent defaults that work well for most setups.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-10

- **Clear Token Guidance**: Better hints showing whether a token is currently set or empty
- **Token Clear Functionality**: Explicitly clear tokens by leaving field empty during reconfiguration
- **Helpful Descriptions**: Clear placeholder text for both initial setup and ongoing management
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows "** AKTUELL GESETZT **" when a token exists vs helpful hints when empty

#### Technical
- **Smart Token Handling**: Empty/whitespace-only input explicitly removes existing tokens
- **Better UX Flow**: Initial setup shows helpful guidance for optional token field
- **Improved Options Flow**: Configuration changes properly handle token clear operations
- **Privacy Maintained**: No token values displayed in UI, only status indicators

This makes token management more intuitive and reduces confusion during initial setup and ongoing configuration.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-10

### 🚨 Improved Error Diagnostics

Enhanced HA Errors Digest with better traceback analysis and grouping for cleaner debugging experience.

#### Enhanced
