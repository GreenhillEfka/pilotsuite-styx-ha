# AI Home CoPilot — Ethics & Governance

This repository provides the **Core add-on** used by AI Home CoPilot.

- Privacy-first, local-first by default.
- Governance-first: suggestions before actions, explicit confirmation, reversible changes.
- Explainability over optimization.
- Autonomy disabled by default.
